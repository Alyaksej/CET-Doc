| image:1.png[] | The system is a modular architecture in which each module performs a separate function and transmit
the results to the next module. The result of each module is described below.

*Module 1.* +

Search module for standard words denoting the type of geographical object, such as area, street, house, building, etc.
 These words require translation, not transliteration. The search algorithm should be based on the search for inaccurate matches and allow the reduction of words or 1-2 errors.
 The search is made on the basis of the list of standard words used in writing the address will and should be in the plug-in and extensible library. When finding the automatic
 translation of words into the target language. Numbers, auxiliary symbols and punctuation marks will be marked as not requiring transliteration or translation.

*Module 2.* +

Words that do not participate in translation in module 2 will be considered proper names and will be transliterated.
Transliteration will be done by syllables. The main problem with transliteration is the lack of knowledge about the
accent and syllable tones, as well as the context. Thus, the transliteration of Chinese names written in Latin cannot
be made unambiguously, the transliteration will have several equally probable variants.

| *Module 3.* +
For each syllable in the title will be selected a number of characters with similar pronunciation.
 The combinatorics of all possible variants can contain both the only correct spelling of the address and a random coincidence with other geographical names.
 For the transliteration of syllables you will use the library from Google allowing commercial use. | image:2.png[]

*Module 4.* +

To solve the problem of multivariance, it is planned to check all equally probable transliteration options by
comparing them with the base of real geographical names. Each of the address options will be checked through the
map search system. As a result, weight coefficients will be assigned depending on the number of search results.

*As systems of cartographic search systems can be used:* +

Open Street Map is an open source project. Can be completely lifted in this project on server capacities of the
customer. The advantage of this approach is the absence of restrictions on the number of requests to the server,
and flexible system setup to achieve the desired performance. The map service is updated by the community and does
not guarantee the relevance of the information. Regular updates are required. +
Baidu Maps – API of the official map service. Regular updating of information, optimization for work in the
Chinese region. Requires commercial use rights.

*Module 5.* +

In the event that two or more transliteration options have similar weights, the user is asked which address he meant
based on the larger geographical areas.

*Module 6.* +

System of statistics collection and user notification. The system will collect the following statistics about the operation of the system

• A system of collecting user-accepted addresses for faster search of the most frequently repeated requests. The system allows you to remember which addresses users specified as correctly transliterated and repeated requests with a perfect match will primarily use the results of previous searches. The system allows you to correct possible errors and improve the user experience.
• A system for collecting metrics on the frequency of errors and the types of these errors during transliteration
The system will issue the following types of errors and warnings
• 01 - Error – all weights showed a low value. None of the variants of transliteration has not been validated as correct.
• 02 - Error – one or more syllables could not be transliterated into hieroglyphs
• 03 – Warning (request to user) – weight coefficients of two or more transliteration variants gave equally high values of weight coefficients
